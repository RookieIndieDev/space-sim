## Space sim intended for use as a ML training environment made in the Godot Engine

### Requirements to satisfy (at least attempt to):

- Environment & Rocket control mechanism independent/decoupled to some extent from origin of control, be it a neural network, player input, random input etc.,
- Provide rich state information of the environment/rocket in a form suitable for ML.
- Environment should be configurable from within the editor but also programmatically for use cases such as POET.
- Suitable for use with variety of ML approaches.
- Doesn't model aerodynamics of the real world precisely, **not** meant for use as an actual Rocket Sim, intended to be more of a fun, toy environment to play around with.
